# Kwawu Arm 3.0 - Socket Version

This is functional device for those with forearm limb differences. It has better functionality and easier to assemble than the Kwawu 2.0 version.

!!!! DO NOT PRINT THESE STL FILES DIRECTLY. !!!!!
Download all the files and use the OpenSCAD to modify and scale the STL files.

The included PDF file "Kwawu 3.0 Socket Version Instructional Guide" will show you how to download the Open SCAD program and use the code in these files to size this model.

I have redesigned the Kwawu arm to be more natural looking and more functional. The terminal device has a much higher grip strength and functionality. Very good at picking up small things with index finger and thumb and big things with whole hand.

This version is the socket version intended for people with short forearm residual limbs.
There is a wrap version for people with long forearm residuals
